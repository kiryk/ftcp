# ftcp
The repo provides functions that allow to use FILE* interface for tcp connections

I uploaded it mainly for my own use, and there is nothing to show off, just some ugly *NIX socket code packed inside 3 functions, so I didn't need to deal with the interface every time I just want to send flat text through TCP.
